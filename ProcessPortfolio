CODING PROCESS PORTFOLIO

Stage I : Learning Game Development
  Before this project, I have no experience in game development. However, I have a lot of experience in Python coding (I am an USACO bronze campion).
  In order to make a video game, I need to learn how to do game develop in an engine
  I need to start coding the game in a week, so I decide to use Godot Engine because it is new user friendly and supports GDscript, a language similar to Python3.
  Using Youtube videos, I squeezed several months of game development lessons into a week.
  In the end, I sucessfully learned how to use Godot Engine to create a 2D game with collision, a player, and enemys.
  
Stage II: Starting the Game
  After talking to my peers, I understand the direction we are going in this game and started to code
  Using the sprites drawn up by the art team, I created a simple game with a main character, blocks, and a background
  There was some collision issues, but I eventually solved it
  The player can jump and move with obeying the laws of physics, such as gravity at 9.8m/s**2 and acceleration of the movements
  Blocks and Backgrounds allowed the game to have a cool asethtics 
  I personally love this game already and can't wait to add in the npcs and enemys to make this game more life-like
  
Stage III: Game Features
  I started off with adding NPCs into the background
  Most of them cannot move, but you can engage with dialogue with them
  #Dialogues will be posted in the resource section
  The sprites from the art team are arriving late, so it effected the rate of progress of the game development. At the moment, I cannot add attack movements and enemys within the game
